New people to the company carry over what they did in their previous job and its not how it works in GT. Its it's own system that you've to learn and bringing in people who are not familiar with UK or ROI statutory requirements is ridiculous. Senior management treat you as though every piece of work could be your last or like someone's life depends on it. You could be in GT years and those that have experience elsewhere think they are superior to you in every way. Communication is horrendous at every level there is. Do not apply for this place if you don't have an accountancy background, you will struggle. Keep your options open for other places, you'll see the shambles of a 'structure' it truly is.",2.0

No vision for the future on how to get there other than to buy smaller firms and absorb their client base - but then have no clue what to do with them.

There is a reason Grant Thornton is top 20 in Canada for culture(Best Places To Work), however, it's very cliquey. If you want to be paid nominally for your productivity, but live without a lot of pressure, take an admin job here. (unless you're actually an accountant - high pressure, low pay until you reach partner)

The company doesn't really value fast learners with high productivity over supporters of the status quo, so make sure to show you aren't special except at the watercooler/lunchroom. This is the most important place in the office. A worker can be relatively incompetent and still have a wonderfully stable place to live their lives if they make the important popular group their friends. Individuals won't be enough.

Furthermore, the people above you would give you like 90% negative feedback not even constructive feedback without discussing it with you ahead and without telling you the reason afterwards.

If there's one thing that I surely miss are the supportive and fun people even Managers and Partners, Busy season treats (Food deliveries and stubs), Paid time-off (Weekends and Holidays) and HMO allowance. Great benefits and good salary for fresh grads. Generally a good company to work for if you are looking for a career in Audit industry. Workload depends on accounts assigned and superiors in the team as well as growth. If your superior is great in extending help and client is cooperative, surely there will be growth and a lot of learnings from experiences. Thankful that it is my first employer.

It is a competitive environment, but you can quickly become well known if you volunteer for proposal work and/or internal initiatives, deliver high-quality client work, and maintain positive relationships with leadership. Additionally, leave is ""unlimited"" in the sense that you can freely flex all your hours.

GT was constantly trying to figure out what they were and what they wanted to do and would go through heavy lengths to rename, reorg and qualify their position to clients. They touted their Russell-2000 clientele stronghold but desperately wanted to be in the F500 ranks of other well established consultancies. If they got in the door at said aforementioned clients it was menial, arduous work at best to help establish a long-term relationship. Management was so sale-centric that often times they would be pitching the next thing while the ship was currently going down on their current project, no life raft in sight.

"Senior Internal Auditor (Former Employee) - Dubai - April 22, 2018","Typical day is working till 4 AM to finish your audits.

Abusing the employees, threatening to fire them and replace them with cheaper options if not agreeing to work overtime and on weekends. ( Slavery)

Overtime is unpaid.

Workplace culture is competitive and unfriendly.

Hardest part is unable to have a work life balance due to being threatened of being fired if your are not overworking.

Dominance of males where if you complain on some actions you get targeted until you leave.

Cons

Many of the partners are so afraid to take risks it kills innovation and creativity. I mean I know these people are accountants, so they are not the most dynamic people, but come on, show a little back bone and take a chance once in awhile. It also seems like it's very much who you know, instead of what you know and your accomplishments to get promoted. Also, salary model is way lower than the competition.

Advice to Management

"EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT (Current Employee) - Minneapolis, MN - March 22, 2018","Please note that I write only from an administrative professional's standpoint.

Started out as a great place to work, great supervisor and good people to work with. Challenging, but fair and flexible.

A few years ago Grant Thornton started on a new ""culture journey"" and that sounded great--inclusion, positive thinking, and the like. Turns out it was all rhetoric, because since then the culture has gone downhill. HR is now called ""People & Culture,"" a definite misnomer.

National keeps making major changes with no regard to the effect they have on those who actually do the work at the ground level. I realize that this is a business, but I no longer feel like a valued member of a team, now I'm just a number on their books.

Administrative professionals have been quitting left and right in the last few years; the company will not replace them, which leaves those of us still left scrambling to keep up. We've been told that partners are being pressured to get out and sell, while simultaneously being given more and more administrative work to track those sales, etc.

Yet recently one of our administrative positions was actually eliminated. We're told this all comes from national and not this office directly, and that they don't anticipate any more ""rightsizing"" (which is what they're calling it instead of downsizing), but the administrative management here didn't even see this coming. I no longer feel appreciated, or any job security here.",3.0

The purpose of those projects was to identify and provide independent and reliable information on the Entity covered by due diligence at the request of potential investor including: identification and assessment of risks and irregularities as well as indicating key information which allows the Investor(s) to make rational acquisition decision. I was responsible for: evaluation of market and competi-tive standing of the Entity, assessment of long-term financial plans of audited Entity, evaluation of correctness of val-uation of assets and liabilities, determination of financial result as well as identification and evaluation of essential economic events having impact on economic and financial standing of audited entity. Due diligence projects in which I participated as a team member or a leading person consist of two parts: business/finance portion and taxation part. Because of that it was necessary for me to gain broad knowledge concerning Polish, European, and International tax laws.
Almost 7-year experience has given me advanced knowledge in terms of accounting, tax issues, financial analysis and accounting management.
