At the time of my employment there was no opportunity for advancement otherwise I never would have left. I was originally hire as a summer research student for one season but ended up staying for four years. During this time I fell chronically ill.

If your someone with a high work ethic stay away! This place was full of people who didn't like seeing others succeed. The management team was hardly on the shop floor and would listen to the opinions of people who did not have your best interest in their thoughts.

Everyone is stressed out. Morale is low. Female leaders at all levels are devalued and being pushed out. Work-life balance is good for most people. Middle management is not great.

"Senior Process Technician (Current Employee) - Pittsburgh, CA - May 25, 2022",Not happy with working at Corteva at all. It's the norm to learn things after the fact instead of up front.

"Corn conditioning tech (Former Employee) - Hedrick, IA - May 9, 2022","The company itself is great with benefits and pay, but the hedrick location has some of the worst managers I have ever worked with in 15 years across multiple states and industries. Expect to get thrown under the bus, set up for failure, and blatant favoritism. A lot of the managers here are former Pella Windows washouts who have no clue how to run a seed plant. They talk down to operators with 30+ years of experience, they pit employees against each other, and will do whatever it takes to make themselves look good.

"Production Technician (Former Employee) - Princeton, IL - April 19, 2022","I would not recommend this employer to anyone. The management is terrible. Only some employees never have to work 2nd or 3rd shift. Supervisors and Leads have their favorites. More knowledge and experience usually lead to more pay, but not at Corteva. It means you have more responsibility without the extra pay. Management looks at everyone as replaceable while all of the skillful employees are leaving. The only way to move up is to be a yes man and let management use you as a doormat. If you aren't in the click, forget it. Management stinks at communicating with all employees, schedule is always changing, as well as your shift with little notice...Training stinks as there is none...there's a reason why this company has a huge turnover but pays well. Don’t fall for the misleading culture/family environment because they don’t care about you. Would have retired here but they made it difficult to even want to come to work. Their thought process is exhausting, and they have no common sense. If you don’t want a life and can be a puppet, then this job is for you. The only good thing was vacation, but they control how you use it. Micromanaged at its finest. Safety is shoved down your throat but rarely swallowed. Winters are cold and summers are hot. Some great people to work with and you can have fun at times. If you never miss time, be obedient, kiss a little bum, never speak up for yourself, and follow the rules without question you will do very well here.",2.0

Safety is number one. Going home the same way you came in is always a good thing. The pay is pretty decent and yearly production bonuses are common. It is NOT the perfect place to work as there is always room for improvement and what works for one may not always be best for others. But is pretty close.,5.0

"Soybean Lab Technician (Current Employee) - Johnston, IA - August 28, 2021","This contract position is a great way to gain hands on skills. It’s hard work but everyone is pretty nice and the managers are great about letting you take time off. There is upward mobility but it’s limited by competition. Contractors start at $14 an hour, the next potion you can advance to is research assistant, where you work directly for the company and make $19 an hour. Since contractors don’t work directly for Corteva we don’t get paid time off, but there is health and dental insurance. The labor (cross pollinating, transplanting, harvesting soybeans etc,) can be hard on your body, but at least the company takes ergonomics very seriously. It’s one of the things I like the most about working for Corteva; if you tell someone a task is hurting your body they really care and help find solutions. There is very little opportunity for overtime, and during a slow we’ll they’ll cut contractors hours by a few day. This happens usually once a month. I enjoyed the extra days off, but for someone in a tight financial situation losing hours could be stressful",4.0
"Seed Technician (Current Employee) - Homedale, ID - August 22, 2021",Working at the homedale ID plant and the management don't care about wear house employees.

I've been there 5-6 years and its just getting worse finally decided to leave and move on a person's mental health is more important then a job that don't care about you or your health. Highly recommend people avoid this place in all honesty.,1.0
"Technical Analyst (Current Employee) - Johnston, IA - August 19, 2021","I have worked at a few places, but this is my favorite and I am compensated considerably higher than my peers. Good culture is universal, but good managemnet varies from department to department like most work places. High sense of inclusion, great benefits, and a flexible return to work policy. No matter which team I was on, the managers always wanted to help me succeed!
They have dealt with the pandemic well, enforcing safety restrictions and placeing the safety of employees above all and they still allow choice when it comes to vaccines.
Overall, I find Corteva to be a great place to work with boundless opportunity for anyone seeking to advance and move around. Easy mobility between job departments if you want to move and there is an overall healthy work environment. The higher you go, the more work there is, but there is still a large emphasis on work/life balance and taking the time you need.
