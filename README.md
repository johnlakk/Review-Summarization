# Review-Summarization

## Task Description: Automated Job Market Analysis using Web Scraping and Summarization

In this task, we have implemented a specialized web scraper that parses 'Indeed' to extract company reviews and related data. Subsequently, we employ a summarization algorithm to generate informative summaries of the extracted information in PDF format.

**Web Scraper:** Our web scraper is meticulously designed to navigate the 'Indeed' website and retrieve valuable data related to company reviews. Users have the flexibility to define specific criteria for the scraper to identify and extract company review information. This criteria might include keywords, locations, or other relevant parameters. The scraper adeptly collects essential details such as company names, review content, ratings, job satisfaction levels, and any other pertinent information. This extracted data is meticulously organized into a structured format, ensuring it's ready for in-depth analysis.

**Summarization Algorithm:** Following the data extraction process, our summarization algorithm takes over to create comprehensive summary reports. These reports encapsulate the insights gleaned from the scraped company reviews. The summary reports are thoughtfully constructed to provide users with a clear understanding of the overall sentiment and trends within the reviews. Moreover, they are generated in PDF format, which enhances their accessibility, making it simple to share and reference these insights.

**Key Features:**

  * Customized Data Extraction: Users can specify their search criteria to focus the scraper on extracting company review data that aligns with their preferences. This tailored approach ensures the extracted data is pertinent to the user's objectives.

  * Comprehensive Summaries: The summarization algorithm transforms the collected data into detailed summary reports. These summaries offer valuable insights into the sentiments expressed in company reviews, helping users gauge employee satisfaction, identify common trends, and potentially make informed decisions regarding prospective employers.

  * PDF Output: The summary reports are conveniently generated in PDF format, facilitating easy sharing and reference. This format also ensures that the information remains organized and readily accessible.

**Project Summary:** This task represents a powerful tool for job seekers, career analysts, and HR professionals. By utilizing our custom web scraper and summarization algorithm, we streamline the process of gathering and analyzing company review data from 'Indeed.' The resulting PDF summary reports offer an efficient way to gain insights into employee sentiments, employer reputations, and prevailing trends within the job market. These insights can be invaluable for job seekers evaluating potential employers or for organizations looking to improve their workplace culture based on feedback and sentiment analysis.
